Overview / Context
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are critical drivers of employment, innovation, and
economic development, particularly in developing and emerging economies. Despite their
importance, many SMEs continue to operate with little or no digital presence, relying heavily
on offline networks such as word-of-mouth referrals.
As customers increasingly depend on digital platforms to discover and evaluate service
providers, SMEs without structured online visibility face reduced market access and limited
growth opportunities. Existing digital solutions are often fragmented, unstructured, or not
designed specifically for SMEs.
This product aims to address this gap by providing a centralized, sector-based digital directory
that allows SMEs to be easily discovered, evaluated, and contacted, while supporting inclusive
digital infrastructure and innovation in line with SDG 9.

Objectives
● Provide SMEs with a simple way to create and manage online business profiles.
● Organize businesses by the industrial sector for structured discovery.
● Build trust through reviews and ratings.
● Support scalable, web-based access for both mobile and desktop users.
● Encourage innovation and market access aligned with SDG 9.
